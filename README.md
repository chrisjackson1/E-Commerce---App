# E-Commerce---App

## Description
    - Our challenge was to build the back end for an e-commerce site. Where were taking a working Express.js API and configuring
     it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Installation

    Start by Cloning this repo on your local machine:

    - $ git clone git@github.com:chrisjackson1/E-Commerce---App.git
    - $ cd e-commerce-backend 

    You will also need to have a .env file in your root directory, in order to connect to your MySQL database.

    - DB_NAME='ecommerce_db'
    - DB_USER='root'
    - DB_PASSWORD=''  

    Create Your Database
    - Drop the schema in your database once logging in.
    - type 'SHOW DATABASE' in the command line to check for your ecommerce_db is there!

    Seeding
    - Once your database is in the system then begin seeding information in.
    - type "node seeds/index" into the command line

    Starting Application
    - Once the seeds are finally in then type, "node server", into the command line to start your Application!

## Usage

    - To finish setting up the application, complete the following steps:

    - To Start the Application

    - Create a MySQL database on your local machine using the schema.sql file located in the /db/ directory(From the MySQL CLI, source db/schema.sql)
    - Seed the database with sample data to be used for testing purposes(Run npm run seed from inside the root directory of the project)
